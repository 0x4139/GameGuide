<p>So you�re ready to play Clash, and find that there�s a ton of 
information out there already. Supercell has a wiki page that describes 
pretty much everything, and there are thousands of videos and guides out
 there on Youtube. What do you do and which one do you follow?</p>
<p>I�m here to tell you not to waste your time. There�s only a couple of
 things you really need to watch out for in the beginner ranks.</p>
<p>Starting off in the game, you�ll notice an automatic shield is 
already up. Be patient and don�t break that shield by attacking � the 
worst thing you can do in the game is break a shield too early. I�ll get
 into more in depth shield strategies later, but trust me � patience and
 shielding is the key to gaining on the leaderboards.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Post 1 - Archer Unit" src="images/Post-1-Archer-Unit-300x225.png" height="225" width="300"></p>
<p>&nbsp;Use the gems that are provided on additional builder huts only.
 This is important � builder huts are an investment that will help you 
snowball into the intermediate ranks. Don�t use those gems on other 
upgrades, even if some of them may look flashy or cool. Stick to the 
basics and go with the builder huts only.</p>
<p>When you first start out, gold and elixir collectors are important. 
You�ll want to be patient here too � don�t upgrade those too quickly as 
other others will want to raid your base and steal your resources. Make 
sure you upgrade your base defenses first. By using your gold to upgrade
 collectors, you sacrifice on your base�s defenses and end up losing all
 those resources anyways when you get raided � this is a huge mistake 
that I see a lot of players making. Make sure you don�t do the same! 
What about gold vs. elixir? Gold is far more important in the early 
levels because 90% of the buildings use gold and not elixir, so focus on
 getting gold over elixir at this time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Post 1 - Barbarian Unit" src="images/Post-1-Barbarian-Unit-300x225.png" height="225" width="300"></p>
<p>&nbsp;The key to the beginner ranks is to upgrade everything in your 
base as much as possible so you have the strongest defenses for that 
Town Hall level. Only after you upgrade all your defenses should you 
consider moving up a Town Hall. Here are some tips for upgrading your 
defense units:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Mortar towers first</strong>
 � these have massive splash damage are the cornerstone to any good 
defense in the early levels. Get these upgraded first and as fast as 
possible. You�ll have the ability to build additional mortars as you 
advance your Town Hall level, but make sure all your current mortars are
 upgraded before you advance your Town Hall level.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Wizard towers next</strong>
 � these towers always provide splash damage when they fire. As you may 
have guessed, splash damage gives you the most efficient defense in 
these levels so you should really focus on those mortar and wizard 
towers. Much like mortar towers, you�ll have the ability to build 
additional ones as you advance your Town Hall level, but make sure all 
your current wizard towers are upgraded before you advance your Town 
Hall level.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Archer towers next</strong>
 � these have great range and attack both air and ground units. In the 
beginner ranks, you won�t really encounter air units very much so many 
people recommend against upgrading Archer towers. This is wrong � even 
without air units attacking you, the archer towers are worth it for 
their long range.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Cannons next</strong>
 � these can only attack ground units, which you will see the most of at
 these levels. I would treat these in the same priority as archer towers
 actually. They provide an extra layer of defense to protect your 
precious resources.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Post 1 - Giant Unit" src="images/Post-1-Giant-Unit-300x225.png" height="225" width="300"></p>
<p>&nbsp;The next topic that I�m going to stress here is the use of walls. <strong>Walls are extremely important</strong>
 to protecting your buildings against attackers. You will need a free 
builder (one who is not currently upgrading anything) in order to build 
or upgrade walls. This is important so listen up � if your defense is 
open, use all your remaining gold on walls once all but one builder is 
free, prior to logging off. Why is this important? This prevents people 
from looting all your gold because you spent it all before logging off, 
so there is no gold to actually loot in your base! If you happen to be 
saving up your gold in storages, make sure your defense is good enough 
to defend � otherwise just listen to me and spend any gold you have on 
walls before you leave the game.</p>
<p>What about <strong>army camps</strong>? You can upgrade your army 
camps following the same guidelines as towers � making sure you upgrade 
everything before you advance to a higher Town Hall. However, I don�t 
think army camps at the beginner levels are a priority at all, since 
army camps are used strictly for offence and in the beginner ranks, 
defense is most important. You�re not strong enough to attack other 
people, so you want to protect your resources until all your units are 
upgraded before you think about attacking.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Post 1 - Goblin Unit" src="images/Post-1-Goblin-Unit-300x225.png" height="225" width="300"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Factories</strong> � there are two types of factories �
 a research factory for you to upgrade units, and a spell factory for 
you to manufacture spells. Neither of these are important in the 
beginner levels to be perfectly honest.</p>
<p>In your research factories, you�ll be able to <strong>upgrade</strong>
 your giants, wallbreakers, archers, barbarians, and goblins. However, 
like I stated before, you should only upgrade units when you�re <span style="text-decoration: underline;">far enough along in your defenses</span>
 and strong enough to start thinking about attacking. The bases you�ll 
be paired up with in any attack scenario will only be 1 Town Hall above 
you max � so make sure at the very minimum your troops are strong enough
 to take out your own base�s fully upgraded defenses before you start 
looking for others. By not upgrading Town Halls too early, stronger 
players won�t be able to find you � which is why you want to upgrade 
everything before moving up Town Halls.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Post 1 - Walbreaker Unit" src="images/Post-1-Walbreaker-Unit-300x225.png" height="225" width="300"></p>
<p>Spells factories should essentially be ignored in the early levels. 
Spells take way too long to cook and they cost too much. In fact, even 
the cheapest spell used in a raid would negate any profit when attacking
 for resources. I�ll cover spell usage in the intermediate and advanced 
sections of this guide later on.</p>
